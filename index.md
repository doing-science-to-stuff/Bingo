These bingo card generators [were](https://doingsciencetostuff.wordpress.com/2020/05/09/cognitive-bias-bingo/) [created](https://doingsciencetostuff.wordpress.com/2020/05/14/logical-fallacy-bingo/) [to](FlawedReasoning/) help people
better understand the psychological principles that contribute to people
holding false beliefs.

Currently there are three bingo card generators:
 * [Cognitive Bias Bingo](CognitiveBias/)
 * [Logical Fallacy Bingo](LogicalFallacy/)
 * [Flawed Reasoning Bingo](FlawedReasoning/) (combines other two)
